# Personal Website

My personal website built with vanilla HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

## Deployment

This site is deployed via GitHub Pages. To deploy:

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
3. Select the branch (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Save

Your site will be live at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]`

## Custom Domain

To use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file in the root with your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
2. Add DNS records:
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `@` or `www`
   - Value: `[your-username].github.io`
3. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" in the Pages settings

## Editing

Just edit `index.html` directly - it's vanilla HTML with Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN.
